Kinematic Equations Solver

Task: Write a program that solves for the final velocity, displacement, or time given the initial velocity, acceleration, and time. 
Implement the kinematic equations and validate the output with sample inputs.

Develop a library that incoorporates the necessary functions or classes to perform essential calculations required by users. 
Also submit a document file about the things you learned while doing the task( be it mathematics, logic or even code syntax ).

Documentation is mandatory regardless of whether the task is completed.If the task is not completed, provide a detailed explanation of the technical 
reasons or challenges that prevented its completion.
